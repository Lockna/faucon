# faucon: NVIDIA Falcon CPU Emulator in Rust

faucon aims to be a spec-compliant emulator of the proprietary NVIDIA Falcon microprocessors,
with a strong focus on a public documentation effort of the processor internals based on
reverse-engineering results.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/vbe0201/faucon/wiki) for documentation on the architecture,
the source code for a reference implementation of the core CPU functionality.

## Components

- [`faucon-asm-derive`](./faucon-asm-derive): Internal implementation details of `faucon-asm`

- [`faucon-asm`](./faucon-asm): A crate for working with the Falcon ISA, effectively providing
a binary disassembler for the emulator

- [`faucon`](./src): The implementation of the CPU emulator

## Setup

Coming soon.

## Contributing

The project is in a very early state and heavily WIP and contributors are welcome.

Contributions to code and documentation are heavily appreciated, may it be a bug fix,
a new feature, or improvement of the code or wiki documentation.
