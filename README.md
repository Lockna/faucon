# faucon: NVIDIA Falcon Microprocessor Suite

faucon aims to provide a comprehensive tooling suite for the Falcon microprocessors, including
an assembler,a  disassembler, a CPU emulator for debugging purposes, and documentation on the
architecture. For the time being, faucon explicitly targets the fuc5 generation of these MCUs.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/vbe0201/faucon/wiki) for architecture documentation.

## Components

- [`faucon-asm-derive`](./faucon-asm-derive): Internal implementation details of `faucon-asm`

- [`faucon-asm`](./faucon-asm): A crate for processing Falcon assembly, providing binary
disassembling capabilities

- [`faucon-emu`](./faucon-emu): Implementation of the CPU functionality for emulation

- [`faucon`](./src): Command-line interface for invoking and driving the provided tools

## Setup

Coming soon.
